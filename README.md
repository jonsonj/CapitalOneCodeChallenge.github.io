The following code is for the Captial One Coding Challenge written by Jonson Jin.

For the challenge I split the work into two parts:

The first part was preprocessing the data, this was done through the use of MATLAB.
I found the data was quite large and the best way to sort through this data was by using 
MATLAB where I removed all listings that I felt were unneeded. I compressed this data and
and wrote it out in a small csv data. I was also able to use MATLAB to generate the three
graphs needed.

The second part cosisted of generating the web application where I used html and Javascript.
I loaded in the preprocessed data and wrote function to calculate the two statistics asked of 
me.
